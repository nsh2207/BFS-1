I used the cycle detection algorithm mentioned in CLRS. I maintained 3 colors, white grey and black. White node represents the nodes which are not visited and grey nodes are the nodes which are present in the DFS stack and its neighbors are still yet to be all visited and black nodes are the ones which are completely visited and they are part of 1 DFS traversal forest. Basically if there occurs a scenario where, a grey node is encountered, it means there exists a backward edge and thus suggests the presence of a cycle
